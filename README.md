<i>
If a sample contains multiple subclusters, thus non-exchangeable, then pairwise distances between observations have higher spread.

Welcome to the homepage of `flinty`, a method for detecting non-exchangeability, or heterogeneity, in multivariate datasets. Details of our method can be found in
> Aw, Spence and Song (2021+) "A Flexible and Robust Non-parametric Test of Exchangeability," *submitted*.
