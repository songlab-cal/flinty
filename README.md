# A Simple and Flexible Test of Sample Exchangeability with Applications to Statistical Genomics

<i>
Given a cluster, dataset, or sample comprising multiple observations, the existence of subclusters, subgroups or stratification is accompanied by a wider spread of pairwise distances between the observations.

Welcome to the homepage of `flinty`, a method for assessing sample non-exchangeability, or heterogeneity, in multivariate datasets. Details of our method can be found in
> Aw, Spence and Song (2023) "A simple and flexible test of sample exchangeability with applications to statistical genomics," *Annals of Applied Statistics* (to appear). Preprint available at [arXiv:2109.15261](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15261).
